// Every month, a random number of students take the driving test at Fast & Furious (F&F) Driving School. To pass the test, a student cannot accumulate more than 18 demerit points.

// At the end of the month, F&F wants to calculate the average demerit points accumulated by ONLY the students who have passed, rounded to the nearest integer.

// Write a function which would allow them to do so. If no students passed the test that month, return 'No pass scores registered.'.


// Example:

// [10,10,10,18,20,20] --> 12

function passed (list) { 

let filter = list.filter((num)=> num <= 18)
if(filter.length === 0){
  return `No pass scores registered.`
}
let sum = filter.reduce((a,b)=> a+b)

let final = sum/filter.length
return Math.round(final)

}
