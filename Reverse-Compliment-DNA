// In genetic the reverse complement of a sequence is formed by reversing the sequence and then taking the complement of each symbol.

// The four nucleotides in DNA is Adenine (A), Cytosine (C), Guanine (G) and Thymine (Thymine).

// A is the complement of T
// C is the complement of G.
// This is a bi-directional relation so:

// T is the complement of A
// G is the complement of C.
// For this kata you need to complete the reverse complement function that take a DNA string and return the reverse complement string.

// Note: You need to take care of lower and upper case. And if a sequence conatains some invalid characters you need to return "Invalid sequence".

// This kata is based on the following one but with a little step in addition.


function reverseComplement(dna) {
    
  if (dna.length === 0) return "";

  let str = "";

  let nuc = {
    T: "A",
    G: "C",
    A: "T",
    C: "G",
  };

  let reverseStr = dna.toUpperCase().split("").reverse().join("");
  for (let d of reverseStr) {
    if (nuc[d] === undefined) return `Invalid sequence`;

    str += nuc[d];
